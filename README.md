## This NPM package contains complete (soon:tm:) types of the Discord user API for [Strife](https://github.com/sussyGaymer/strife).

>It's still a huge WIP so any and all contributions are well-desired :)

## Usage
For now and the forseeable future strife-types and Strife itself will not be published on NPM so it's required for you to download the repository, build it and link it manually using `npm link`. Instructions may or may not be coming soon:tm:.

## Contributing
Pull requests and issues are more than welcome and won't go ignored (unless you deserve it).
