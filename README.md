## This NPM package contains complete (soon:tm:) types of the Discord user API for [Strife](https://github.com/sussyGaymer/strife).

> It's still a huge WIP so any and all contributions are well-desired :)

## Usage

The package is not complete yet, therefore usage is illadvised. You can still clone the repo and `npm link` it to your project though. It will be on the NPM registry when finished.

## Contributing

Pull requests and issues are more than welcome and won't go ignored (unless you deserve it).
